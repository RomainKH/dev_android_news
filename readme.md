# Android News Applications

We had to make an android application using kotlin and we choose to make a news application.

## Features

For the moment you can : 
* get the latest news of all categories on a specific country.
* 54 countries are available with local sources. 
* You can also get the latest news about specific categories such as technology or sport.
* Link (when available) to the news source.

## Ameliorations

* We could add a search bar and filter news with the published date.
* Next and Previous buttons on article pages.

## Technology

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
